  Independent implementation of MD5 (RFC 1321).

  This code implements the MD5 Algorithm defined in RFC 1321, whose
  text is available at
    http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt
  The code is derived from the text of the RFC, including the test suite
  (section A.5) but excluding the rest of Appendix A.  It does not include
  any code or documentation that is identified in the RFC as being
  copyrighted.

The original and principal author of md5.h is L. Peter Deutsch
<ghost@aladdin.com>.  Other authors are noted in the change history
that follows (in reverse chronological order):

2002-04-13 lpd Removed support for non-ANSI compilers; removed
references to Ghostscript; clarified derivation from RFC 1321;
now handles byte order either statically or dynamically.
1999-11-04 lpd Edited comments slightly for automatic TOC extraction.
1999-10-18 lpd Fixed typo in header comment (ansi2knr rather than md5);
added conditionalization for C++ compilation from Martin
Purschke <purschke@bnl.gov>.
1999-05-03 lpd Original version.

Implementation of the RIPE-MD Hash Algorithms.
Based on the SHA-1 implementation, (C) by A.M. Kuchling

The ripemd160 code was written by Nikos Mavroyanopoulos, the code
for ripemd128, ripemd256 and ripemd320 was added by B. Poettering
in April 2004.

Based on SHA code originally posted to sci.crypt by Peter Gutmann
   in message <30ajo5$oe8@ccu2.auckland.ac.nz>.
   Modified to test for endianness on creation of SHA objects by AMK.
   Also, the original specification of SHA was found to have a weakness
   by NSA/NIST.  This code implements the fixed version of SHA.

Here's the first paragraph of Peter Gutmann's posting:

The following is my SHA (FIPS 180) code updated to allow use of the "fixed"
SHA, thanks to Jim Gillogly and an anonymous contributor for the information on
what's changed in the new version.  The fix is a simple change which involves
adding a single rotate in the initial expansion function.  It is unknown
whether this is an optimal solution to the problem which was discovered in the
SHA or whether it's simply a bandaid which fixes the problem with a minimum of
effort (for example the reengineering of a great many Capstone chips).
