                     The Falcon Programming Language

                    Web Oriented Programming Interface

                                  1.0


APACHE WOPI FRONT-END MODULE
============================

  This module allows a smooth integration of the Falcon Programming Language
with the Apache web server. The integration consists of a simple embedding
which owns a virtual machine for each script being run by the server, and
a module which add some functionalities and allows the scripts to interact
with the surrounding environment (aka the web server).

  The internal module is directly injected into every script executed by this
module, so it appears to be a part of a language (we may say, an Apache-server
specific extension).


Installation instructions
=========================

  Once the mod_falcon.so is placed in the Apache2 modules directory, it is
necessary to set its configuration. The directory conf/ contains a some files
meant to serve as a template to configure Apache 2:

   * falcon.conf can be copied and included directly as-is. It is quite a
     standard configuration of an "if mod_falcon.c" section. It contains an
     entry that allows the falcon.ini file to be in a non-standard location.

     Consider this example :

     +-------------------------------------------------------------------+
     |                                                                   |
     |   LoadModule falcon_module /opt/csw/apache2/libexec/mod_falcon.so |
     |   <IfModule mod_falcon.c>                                         |
     |       AddType application/x-falcon-module .fam                    |
     |       AddType application/x-falcon-source .fal                    |
     |       AddType application/x-falcon-ftd .ftd                       |
     |       FalconConfig "/etc/opt/csw/mod_falcon/falcon.ini"           |
     |   </IfModule>                                                     |
     |                                                                   |
     +-------------------------------------------------------------------+

   * falcon.load is just a reminder to create a proper LoadModule entry
     in httpd.conf/apache.conf and get in mod_falcon.

  Other than that, it is necessary to copy falcon.ini as specified in
falcon.conf ( possibly into /etc ), and configure it to make it fit to your
needs.  The above example is perfectly valid and consistent with the SVR4
software package spec on UNIX(tm) systems such as Solaris. In the above
example you see that the configuration file has been correctly placed within
the /etc/opt/%vendorname%/%software_name%/ directory.


Contents of the falcon.ini file
===============================

  Here is a typical configuration file that allows for basic functionality.
This may not fit your needs but it is a simple starting point.
